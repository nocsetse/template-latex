\begin{abstract}
	The goal of this project paper is to detail my use of MIT Kerberos and OpenLDAP as an authentication mechanism for private cloud 
    computing environments. In addition to how the authentication mechanism is installed and configured, this paper will illustrate ways of
	using the mechanism to provision user accounts and show some examples of how the framework might be employed. The intent
	is to create an implementation that can be easily reproduced.
